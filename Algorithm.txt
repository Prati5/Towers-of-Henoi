 Algorithm For Towers Of Henoi Problem
// Computation of towers of  Hanoi problem using recurssive method
//input:  Number of Disks inserted into the initial tower
//output: Moves/steps required to move all disk from sorce to destination.
Step1: Move the top n-1 disks from source B to auxillary tower A
Step2: Move the nth dist from auxillary A to destination tower E.
Step 3: Transffering the top n-1 disks from source can be solved in the same manner.
step 4:   function
            void TowerOfHenoi(int n,char B,char A,char E)
  {
        if(n>=1)
          {
             TowerOfHenoi(n-1,B,A,E);
             printf("Move disk from %c to %c\n",B,E);
             TowerOfHenoi(n-1,A,E,B);
           }
}
